        New Dawn Doula Services is a Calgary-based business providing birth planning and support for women and partners
        in the greater Calgary area since 2014. We believe that <strong>every</strong> mother should have the benefit of a doula's support whether
        they are expecting their first child or fifth. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hiring a doula to support you during child birth ensures you will have a professional on-hand who is dedicated to <em>you</em>
        and advocating <em>your wishes</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21328263">Studies show that continuous one-to-one support results in fewer caesarean births 
        and more satisfied mothers.</a>

            My name is Melanie. I'm an avid reader, coffee drinker, and lover of all things birth and babies. Especially that 
            after-birth high we doulas get after welcoming a baby earthside. ‚ù§
          </p>
          <p>
            I love everything about being a Doula. The births you barely make it to, the long labours that leave you in awe of the mama that 
            worked so hard to birth her little one. Homebirths, c-sections and everything in between, it's an honor to witness 2 people become 
            parents for the first time or fifth.
